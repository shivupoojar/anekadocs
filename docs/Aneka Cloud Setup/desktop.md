# Aneka Desktop Clouds
Aneka Cloud Application Platform (CAP) can be set up to manage a collection of services deployed atop an infrastructure. This infrastructure may encompass physical machines (such as desktops) situated within your local area network, typically found in your laboratory environment. Aneka Management Studio serves as the tool for configuring these clouds.

### Software requirements:
* Windows (Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012) Operating System, either 32-bit or 64-bit.
* All PC with .NET Framework 4.5 or higher
* Microsoft visual studio community edition 2019  or later for development.

## Prerequisites
Prior to setting up the Ankea Desktop clouds, ensure you have the following prerequisites prepared:

- [x] IP addresses of all the desktop machines intended to be added to the cluster should be collected beforehand.
- [x] An `Administrator` username should be enbaled on all the machines and set the password.
- [x] Each machine should have a unique hostname assigned to it.
- [x] Disable the (Private & Public) Windows firewall on each machine.
- [x] Ensure that each machine has .Net 4.5 installed (Note: Windows 7 and 8 come with .Net 4.5 pre-installed by default).
- [x] All machines should be accessible from each other (i.e., when you ping machines from each other including from masters to other workers PCs/VMs should be working).

## Installing Aneka Clouds
This section assumes that you have a copy of the Aneka distribution with you. If you do not have a copy already, you can download the latest version from Manjrasoftâ€™s Website.

* Navigate to the directory where the downloaded Aneka installer file (`Aneka*.msi`) is located, then double-click on the file to initiate the installation process. Follow the prompts until the installation is complete.

* Following the installation, you should find the Aneka-related files located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Manjrasoft\Aneka.5.0`.

* Take a look inside the folder containing the files used to set up the Aneka clouds.
??? note "Info about folders"
    1. The `Docs` folder contains a set of PDF files utilized as documentation for learning Aneka setup and programming.
    2. The `Examples` folder includes sample examples developed using Aneka Thread, Task, and MapReduce APIs, accompanied by source code in both C# and Visual Basic.
    3. The `RunTime` folder contains the dll's used to install Aneka Deamon and Containers.
    4. The `Tools` folder contains the sub folders with `SDK` and  `Managment Studio` files used to setup and application development.
* Open by double click *Aneka Management Studio* application located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Manjrasoft\Aneka.5.0\Tools\Management Studio\Aneka.UI.Manager`
* Press `No` (Do you want to provide a different configuration) on pop up displayed after opening the application.
